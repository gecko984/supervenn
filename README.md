# supervenn: precise and easy-to-read multiple sets visualization in Python

### What it is
**supervenn** is a matplotlib-based tool for visualization of any number of intersecting sets. It takes native Python
`set`s as inputs. Note that `supervenn` does not produce actual (Euler-)Venn diagrams.

The easiest way to understand how supervenn diagrams work, is to compare some simple examples to their Euler-Venn
counterparts. Top row is Euler-Venn diagrams made with [matplotlib-venn](https://github.com/konstantint/matplotlib-venn)
package, bottom row is supervenn diagrams:

### Installation
`pip install supervenn`

### Requirements
Python 2.7 or 3.6+ with `numpy` and`matplotlib`.

### Basic usage 
The main entry point is the eponymous `supervenn` function. It takes a list of python `set`s as its first and only
required argument and returns a `SupervennPlot` object.
```python
from supervenn import supervenn
sets = [{1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 6, 7, 8}]
supervenn(sets, side_plots=False)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/aAOP6dq.png" width=330>

Each row repesents a set, the order from bottom to top is the same as in the `sets` list. Overlapping parts correspond
to set intersections.

The numbers at the bottom show the sizes (cardinalities) of all intersections, which we will call **chunks**.
The sizes of sets and their intersections (chunks) are up to proportion, but the order of elements is not preserved,
e.g. the leftmost chunk of size 3 is `{6, 7, 8}`.

A combinatorial optimization algorithms is applied that rearranges the chunks (the columns of the
array plotted) to minimize the number of parts the sets are broken into. In the example above each set is in one piece
( no gaps in rows at all), but it's not always possible, even for three sets:

```python
supervenn([{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {1, 3}], side_plots=False)
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/8aTSg2A.png" width="330">

By default, additional *side plots* are also displayed:

```python
supervenn(sets)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9IhLBcK.png" width=330>
Here, the numbers on the right are the set sizes (cardinalities), and numbers on the top show how many sets does this
intersection make part of. The grey bars represent the same numbers visually.

If you need only one of the two side plots, use `side_plots='top'` or `side_plots='right'`

### Features (how to)

#### Plot the chart if you don't have the sets themselves, but rather the intersection sizes
Use the utility function `make_sets_from_chunk_sizes` to produce synthetic sets of integers from your intersection sizes,
and then pass these sets to supervenn(). 

```python
from supervenn import supervenn, make_sets_from_chunk_sizes
sets, labels = make_sets_from_chunk_sizes(sizes_df)  # see below for the structure of sizes_df
supervenn(sets, labels)
```

Intersection sizes `sizes_df` should be a `pandas.DataFrame` with the following structure:

- For N sets, it must have N boolean (or 0/1) columns and the last column must be integer, so N+1 columns in total.
- Each row represents a unique intersection (chunk) of the sets. The boolean value in column 'set_x' indicate whether
this chunk lies within set_x. The integer value represents the size of the chunk.

For example, consider the following dataframe

```
   set_1  set_2  set_3  size
0  False   True   True     1
1   True  False  False     3
2   True  False   True     2
3   True   True  False     1
```

It represents a configuration of three sets such that
- [row 0] there is one element that lies in set_2 and set_3 but not in set_1
- [row 1] there are three elements that lie in set_1 only and not in set_2 or set_3
- etc two more rows.

#### Add custom set annotations instead of 'set_1', 'set_2' etc
Use the `set_annotations` argument to pass a list of annotations. It should be in the same order as the sets. It is
the second positional argument.
```python
sets = [{1, 2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 6, 7, 8}]
labels = ['alice', 'bob', 'third party']
supervenn(sets, labels)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YlPKs7u.png" width=330>

#### Change size and dpi of the plot
Create a new figure and plot into it:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 8))
supervenn(sets)
```

The `supervenn` function has `figsize` and `dpi` arguments, but they are **deprecated** and will be removed in a future
version. Please don't use them.

#### Plot into an existing axis
Use the `ax` argument:

```python
supervenn(sets, ax=my_axis)
```

#### Access the figure and axes objects of the plot
Use `.figure` and `axes`  attributes of the object returned by `supervenn()`. The `axes` attribute is
organized as a dict with descriptive strings for keys: `main`, `top_side_plot`, `right_side_plot`, `unused`. 
If `side_plots=False`, the dict has only one key `main`.

#### Save the plot to an image file

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
supervenn(sets)
plt.savefig('myplot.png')
```

#### Use a different ordering of chunks (columns)
Use the `chunks_ordering` argument. The following options are available:
- `'minimize gaps'`: default, use an optimization algorithm to find an order of columns with fewer
gaps in each row;
- `'size'`: bigger chunks go first;
- `'occurrence'`: chunks that are in more sets go first;
- `'random'`: randomly shuffle the columns.

To reverse the order (e.g. you want smaller chunks to go first), pass `reverse_chunks_order=False` (by default
it's `True`) 

#### Reorder the sets (rows) instead of keeping the order as passed into function
Use the `sets_ordering` argument. The following options are available:
- `None`: default - keep the order of sets as passed into function;
- `'minimize gaps'`: use the same algorithm as for chunks to group similar sets closer together. The difference in the
algorithm is that now gaps are minimized in columns instead of rows, and they are weighted by the column widths
(i.e. chunk sizes), as we want to minimize total gap width;
- `'size'`: bigger sets go first;
- `'chunk count'`: sets that contain most chunks go first;
- `'random'`: randomly shuffle the rows.

To reverse the order (e.g. you want smaller sets to go first), pass `reverse_sets_order=False` (by default
it's `True`) 

#### Inspect the chunks' contents
`supervenn(sets, ...)` returns a `SupervennPlot` object, which has a `chunks` attribute.
It is a `dict` with `frozenset`s of set indices as keys, and chunks as values. For example, 
`my_supervenn_object.chunks[frozenset([0, 2])]` is the chunk with all the items that are in `sets[0]` and
`sets[2]`, but not in any of the other sets.

There is also a `get_chunk(set_indices)` method that is slightly more convenient, because you
can pass a `list` or any other iterable of indices instead of a `frozenset`. For example:
`my_supervenn_object.get_chunk([0, 2])`. 

If you have a good idea of a more convenient method of chunks lookup, let me know and I'll
implement it as well.

#### Make the plot prettier if sets and/or chunks are very different in size
Use the `widths_minmax_ratio` argument, with a value between 0.01 and 1. Consider the following example
```python
sets = [set(range(200)), set(range(201)), set(range(203)), set(range(206))]
supervenn(sets, side_plots=False)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/i05lgNU.png" width=330>

Annotations in the bottom left corner are unreadable.

One solution is to trade exact chunk proportionality for readability. This is done by making small chunks visually
larger. To be exact, a linear function is applied to the chunk sizes, with slope and intercept chosen so that the
smallest chunk size is exactly `widths_minmax_ratio` times the largest chunk size. If the ratio is already greater than
this value, the sizes are left unchanged. Setiing `widths_minmax_ratio=1` will result in all chunks being displayed as
same size.

```python
supervenn(sets, side_plots=False, widths_minmax_ratio=0.05)
```
The image now looks clean, but chunks of size 1 to 3 look almost the same.

#### Avoid clutter in the X axis annotations
- Use the `min_width_for_annotation` argument to hide annotations for chunks smaller than this value. 
```python
supervenn(sets, side_plots=False, min_width_for_annotation=100)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/YdCmHtZ.png" width=330>

- Pass `rotate_col_annotations=True` to print chunk sizes vertically.

- There's also `col_annotations_ys_count` argument, but it is **deprecated** and will be removed in a future version.

#### Change bars appearance in the main plot
Use arguments `bar_height` (default `1`), `bar_alpha` (default `0.6`), `bar_align` (default `edge`)', `color_cycle` (
default is current style's default palette). You can also use styles, for example:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
with plt.style.context('bmh'):
    supervenn([{1,2,3}, {3,4}])
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/yEUChI4.png" width="330">


#### Change side plots size and color
Use `side_plot_width` (in inches, default 1) and `side_plot_color` (default `'tab:gray'`) arguments.

#### Change axes labels from `SETS`, `ITEMS` to something else
Just use `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel` as usual.

#### Change other parameters
Other arguments can be found in the docstring to the function. 

### Algorithm used to minimize gaps
If there are are no more than 8 chunks, the optimal permutation is found with exhaustive search (you can increase this
limit up to 12 using the `max_bruteforce_size` argument). For greater chunk counts, a randomized quasi-greedy algorithm
is applied. The description of the algorithm can be found in the docstring to `supervenn._algorithms` module.

### Less trivial examples: 

#### Words with many meanings

```python
letters = {'a', 'r', 'c', 'i', 'z'}
programming_languages = {'python', 'r', 'c', 'c++', 'java', 'julia'}
animals = {'python', 'buffalo', 'turkey', 'cat', 'dog', 'robin'}
geographic_places = {'java', 'buffalo', 'turkey', 'moscow'}
names = {'robin', 'julia', 'alice', 'bob', 'conrad'}
green_things = {'python', 'grass'}
sets = [letters, programming_languages, animals, geographic_places, names, green_things]
labels = ['letters', 'programming languages', 'animals', 'geographic places',
          'human names', 'green things']
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
supervenn(sets, labels , sets_ordering='minimize gaps')
```

And this is how the figure would look without the smart column reordering algorithm:

Figure made with supervenn (using the `widths_minmax_ratio` argument)

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
supervenn(sets_list, species_names, widths_minmax_ratio=0.1,
          sets_ordering='minimize gaps', rotate_col_annotations=True, col_annotations_area_height=1.2)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/1FGvOLu.png" width=850>

For comparison, here's the same data visualized to scale (no `widths_minmax_ratio`, but argument
`min_width_for_annotation` is used instead to avoid column annotations overlap):

```python
plt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))
supervenn(sets_list, species_names, rotate_col_annotations=True,
          col_annotations_area_height=1.2, sets_ordering='minimize gaps',
          min_width_for_annotation=180)

```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MgUqkL6.png" width=850>

It must be noted that `supervenn` produces best results when there is some inherent structure to the sets in question.
This typically means that the number of non-empty intersections is significantly lower than the maximum possible
(which is `2^n_sets - 1`). This is not the case in the present example, as 62 of the 63 intersections are non-empty, 
hence the results are not that pretty.

#### Order IDs in requests to a multiple vehicle routing problem solver
This was actually my motivation in creating this package. The team I'm currently working in provides an API that solves
a variation of the Multiple Vehicles Routing Problem. The API solves tasks of the form
"Given 1000 delivery orders each with lat, lon, time window and weight, and 50 vehicles each with capacity and work
shift, distribute the orders between the vehicles and build an optimal route for each vehicle". 

A given client can send tens of such requests per day and sometimes it is useful to look at their requests and
understand how they are related to each other in terms of what orders are included in each of the requests. Are they
sending the same task over and over again  - a sign that they are not satisfied with routes they get and they might need
our help in using the API? Are they manually editing the routes (a process that results in more requests to our API, with
only the orders from affected routes included)? Or are they solving for several independent order sets and are happy
with each individual result?

We can use `supervenn` with ome custom annotations to look at sets of order IDs in each of the client's requests.
Here's an example of an OK but nit perfect client's workday:
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9YfRC61.png" width=800>

Rows from bottom to top are requests to our API from earlier to later, represented by their sets of order IDs.
We see that they solved a big task at 10:54, were not satisfied with the result, and applied some manual edits until
11:11. Then in the evening they re-solved the whole task twice over, probably with some change in parameters.

Here's a perfect day:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/E2o2ela.png" width=800>

They solved three unrelated tasks and were happy with each (no repeated requests, no manual edits; each order is
distributed only once).

And here's a rather extreme example of a client whose scheme of operation involves sending requests to our API every
15-30 minutes to account for live updates on newly created orders and couriers' GPS positions.

### Comparison to similar tools

#### [matplotlib-venn](https://github.com/konstantint/matplotlib-venn) 
This tool plots area-weighted Venn diagrams with circles for two or three sets. But the problem with circles
is that they are pretty useless even in the case of three sets. For example, if one set is symmetrical difference of the
other two:
```python
from matplotlib_venn import venn3
set_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}
set_2 = {3, 4, 5}
set_3 = set_1 ^ set_2
venn3([set_1, set_2, set_3], set_colors=['steelblue', 'orange', 'green'], alpha=0.8)
```
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Mijyzj8.png" width=260>

See all that zeros? This image makes little sense. The `supervenn`'s approach to this problem is to allow the sets to be
broken into separate parts, while trying to minimize the number of such breaks and guaranteeing exact proportionality of
all parts:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/e3sMQrO.png" width=400>


#### [UpSetR and pyUpSet](https://caleydo.org/tools/upset/)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ImSoErgodic/py-upset/master/pictures/basic.png" width=800>
This approach, while very powerful, is less visual, as it displays, so to say only _statistics about_ the sets, not the
sets in flesh.

#### [pyvenn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/tctianchi/pyvenn)
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/tctianchi/pyvenn/venn6.png" width=800>
This package produces diagrams for up to 6 sets, but they are not in any way proportional. It just has pre-set images
for every given sets count, your actual sets only affect the labels that are placed on top of the fixed image,
not unlike the banana diagram above. 

#### [RainBio](http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/appliweb/rainbio/index.html) ([article](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02264217/document))
This approach is quite similar to supervenn. I'll let the reader decide which one does the job better:

_Thanks to Dr. Bilal Alsallakh for referring me to this work_

#### [Linear Diagram Generator](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/pjr/linear/index.html?abstractDescription=programming_languages+1%0D%0Aletters+programming_languages+2%0D%0Aprogramming_languages+animals+green_things+1%0D%0Ageographic_places+1%0D%0Aletters+3%0D%0Ahuman_names+3%0D%0Agreen_things+1%0D%0Aprogramming_languages+geographic_places+1%0D%0Aanimals+2%0D%0Aanimals+geographic_places+2%0D%0Aanimals+human_names+1%0D%0Aprogramming_languages+human_names+1%0D%0A&width=700&height=250&guides=lines)
This tool has a similar concept, but only available as a Javascript web app with minimal functionality, and you have to
compute all the intersection sizes yourself. Apparently there is also an columns rearrangement algorithm in place, but
the target function (number of gaps within sets) is higher than in the diagram made with supervenn.
