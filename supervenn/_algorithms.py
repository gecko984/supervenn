    A semi-formal explanation of what is going on here
    ==================================================

    CHUNKS

    Consider a three-way Venn diagram, shown below using squares rather than the usual circles, for obvious reasons.
    It is easy to see that the three squares S1, S2, S3 break each other into seven elementary undivided parts, which we
    will name :chunks:. The 7 chunks are marked as ch1 - ch7.


              *-------S1-------*
              |                |
              |           ch1  |
        *-----|---------*      |
        |     |  ch4    |      |
        |     |         |      |
        |     |   *-----|------|-----*
        |     |   | ch7 | ch5  |     |
       S2     |   |     |      |     |
        |     *---|-----|------*     |
        |         |     |            |
        |  ch2    | ch6 |            S3
        *---------|-----*            |
                  |          ch3     |
                  |                  |
                  *------------------*

    The number 7 is easily derived by the following simple consideration. Each chunk is defined by a unique
    subset of {S1, S2, S3}. For example, chunk ch4 is defined by {S1, S2} - it consists of exactly the points that lie
    inside S1 and S2, but outside of S3. So the number of chunks is 2^3 - 1, 2^3 being the number of possible subsets of
    {S1, S2, S3}, and -1 being for the empty set which has no business being among our chunks.

    Note that, depending on how the three squares are positioned, there can be less chunks then 7. For instance, if the
    three squares are disjoint, the number of chunks will be 3, as each square will be a chunk in itself.

    What is important for us about the chunks, is that they are like the elementary building blocks of our
    configuration of squares. In other words, we can represent any of the squares as a disjoint union of some of the
    chunks. Also any combination of the squares w.r.t. the set-theoretical operations of intersection, union and
    difference can be represented in the same way.

    Now let's move from squares on the plane to abstract finite sets. The same line of reasoning leads us to
    the conclusion that for N sets S1, ..., SN, there exist at most 2^N - 1 chunks (sets), such that any of the sets
    (and any combination of the sets w.r.t union, intersection and difference) can be uniquely represented as the
    disjoint union of several of the chunks.

    COMPOSITION ARRAY

    Suppose we have N sets S1, ..., SN, and we have found the chunks ch1, ... chM. As we said above, each of the sets
    can be uniquely represented as a disjoint union of some of the chunks. Suppose we have found such decompositions for
    all of the sets.
    Now, represent the decompositions as a N x M array of zeros and ones, where the i,j-th item is 1 <=> set S_i
    contains chunk ch_j. We'll call this array the :composition array: of our sets.
    For example, for the squares above, the composition array will look like this:

       ch1  ch2  ch3  ch4  ch5  ch6  ch7
    S1  1    0    0    1    1    0    1  ->  Square 1 is made up of chunks ch1, ch4, ch5 and ch7
    S2  0    1    0    1    0    1    1
    S3  0    0    1    0    1    1    1

    Note that since chunks are something we've just made up by ourselves, they don't have to be ordered in any
    particular way. This means that we can reorder the chunks (= the columns if the composition array) if we
    need to.

    Most part of the present module is actually about finding a permutations of the columns, that will minimize the
    number of gaps between the 1's in all the rows of the array, so that the sets are visually broken into as few parts
    as possible.

    For the array above, we see that there are 5 total zero-filled gaps between ones: one in the first row, two in the
    second, one in the third. But if we find and apply the right permutation of columns, we'll have only one gap between
    the 1's in the whole array, highlighted by asterisks below:


       ch1  ch4  ch2  ch6  ch7  ch5  ch3
    S1  1    1   *0*   1    1    0    0
    S2  0    1    1    1    1    0    0
    S3  0    0    0    1    1    1    1

    When there are few chunks (say, no more than 8) the optimal permutations is easily found in a bruteforce manner by
    checking all the possible permutations. But for a greater number of chunks this would take too long. So instead an
    approximate greedy algorithm with randomization is used. It is implemented in the run_randomized_greedy_algorithm()
    function. The algorithm will be described below.

    REORDERING THE ROWS / SETS

    Unlike the order of chunks, the order of sets can be relevant in some cases. For example, our sets sets may relate
    to different moments in time, and we may deem it important to preserve this temporal structure in the plot. But in
    other cases when there is no inherent order to our sets, we might want to reorder the sets (rows of the composition
    array) so that similar sets are closer to each other.

    This is done by running the same algorithm on the transposed array. But there is an important distinction here: the
    chunks are of different size, and it makes more sense to minimize total gap width, instead of just gap count.
    To allow that, the run_randomized_greedy_algorithm() function accepts an additional argument named :row_weights:,
    and minimizes gap counts weighted with these coefficients. In other words, the minimization target becomes
    sum_i(gaps_count_in_row[i] * row_weights[i]) instead of just sum_i(gaps_count_in_row[i]).

    DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM

    Recall that our goal is to a find a permutation of columns of a matrix of zeros and ones, so that the row-weighted
    sum of gaps counts in rows is as low as possible.

    Define similarity of two columns as the sum of row weights for rows where the values are equal in the two columns.
    Precompute matrix of similarities of all columns (if arr has N columns, this matrix has shape N x N)
    Find two most similar columns C1, C2, initialize two lists [C1,] and [C2,]
    Among the remaining N-2 columns, find one that has largest similarity to either of C1 or C2. Append that column to
    the corresponding list. E.g. we now have lists [C1, C3] and [C2,]
    Among the remaining N-3 columns find one that has largest similarity to the last elemt of either of the lists (in
    our example, C3 and C2). Append it to the corresponding list.
    Continue until all columns are distributed between in two lists.
    Finally, one of the lists is reversed and the other is concatenated to it on the right, which gives the resulting
    permutation. This concludes the greedy algorithm.

    To mitigate the greediness, the similarity matrix is perturbed by means of adding a random matrix R with
    elements {0, noise_value} with a fixed  probability of non-zero, and the whole greedy procedure is repeated.
    This is done with :seeds: different random matrices, and so :seeds: + 1 permutations are obtained (including the one
    produced from the unperturbed similarities matrix). The permutation that yields the smallest value
    of count_runs_of_ones_in_rows(arr[:, permutation]) is returned.
